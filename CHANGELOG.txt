BT Tag Writer 2 Changelog

*** #15 v1.9.1 [2014-07-13]
 * Gradle project
 * Android KitKat dependency 4.4+
 * Replacing dark colors with bright colors
 * Adding Bluetooth Low Energy support as requested (no clear use case for this yet)
 * Not in Play Store yet

*** #10 v1.0 [2013-08-09]
 * Removed all pairing functionality from code, as it can not be used in 4.1+ versions.
 * Compatibility mode added. This will write proper tags that also should work with other than
   Android devices. Tested with Windows Phone 8.
 * Many fixes to data written to tags (Android accepts quite broken data).
 * Some highres icons added
 * Code cleaned a little bit, I hated my 2yo Java coding so much :)
 * Fixes #1

*** #7 v0.6.1 [2012-07-16]
  * Ok, stupid me, looks like old tags were already understood by Android 4.1+
    So hiding Jelly Bean option for now. Same tags should work with both.
    This option can be re-enabled later if it will offer better device support
    (WinMo, iOS...?).

*** #6 v0.6 [2012-07-16]
  * Moved back to proper Android design with usage of back button
  * Added support for writing tags that Jelly Bean understands without need of
    having this software installed.

*** #5 v0.5 [2012-06-26]
  * Bug fixes
  * Removed forced Bluetooth filtering and replaced it with better UI and
    optional filtering.

*** #4 v0.4 [2012-03-30]
  * Now for Android 4.0.3+
  * Not only Mifare Ultralights (support via Ndef and NdefFormatable)
  * Headsets hidden as connecting to those is failing
  * 1 crash fix
  * UI changes ("ICS styled")

*** #3 v0.3 [2011-12-20]
  * Mistake in 0.2 release fixed. Now paired devices are also shown if
    Bluetooth is enabled by application.

*** #2 v0.2 [2011-12-20]
  * Also use list of paired devices to populate discovery list in wizard
